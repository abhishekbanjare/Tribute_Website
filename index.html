                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
                      aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in 
                      Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist 
                      and  science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space 
                      Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile 
                      development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
                      ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and 
                      political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
